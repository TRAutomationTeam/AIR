    "Certainly! Below is a numbered list of actionable suggestions to address each issue in your UiPath workflows:\n\n---\n\n### **Error: UI-DBP-006 (Missing Exception Handling)**",
    "**Add TryCatch Blocks**: Surround activities that may throw exceptions with `TryCatch` blocks to handle errors gracefully. Log exceptions using `Log Message` activities within the `Catch` block and implement recovery logic or rethrow exceptions as needed.\n\n---\n\n### **Warning: UI-DBP-013 (Missing Logging)**",
    "**Add LogMessage Activities**: Insert `Log Message` activities at key points in the workflow (e.g., before/after major operations, decision points, or exception handling) to improve traceability. Use appropriate log levels (`Info`, `Warning`, `Error`) based on the message's importance.\n\n---\n\n### **Warning: UI-DBP-007 (Missing Comments)**",
    "**Add Comments**: Add clear, concise comments to explain complex logic, decision-making processes, or assumptions in your workflows. This helps other developers understand your code and reduces maintenance effort.\n\n---\n\n### **Warning: UI-DBP-008 (Hardcoded Values)**",
    "**Use Configuration Files**: Replace hardcoded values with variables populated from configuration files (e.g., `Config.xlsx`) or arguments. Store values like file paths, URLs, or timeout durations in a centralized location to improve maintainability.\n\n---\n\n### **Error: ST-NMG-001 (Missing Naming Convention)**",
    "**Adopt Standard Naming Conventions**: Rename variables, arguments, activities, and workflows to follow UiPath's naming conventions:\n   - Use **camelCase** for variables (e.g., `inputData`, `transactionItem`).\n   - Use **PascalCase** for arguments (e.g., `InputFilePath`, `OutputResult`).\n   - Include prefixes for activities (e.g., `Assign_`, `Log_`, `Invoke_`) to describe their purpose.\n\n---\n\n### **Error: ST-USG-002 (Unused Variable Detected)**",
    "**Remove Unused Variables**: Review all variables in your workflows and delete any that are unused. This improves readability and avoids unnecessary memory allocation during execution.\n\n---\n\n### **Warning: UI-PRF-001 (Performance Impact)**",
    "**Optimize Delay Times**: Minimize or eliminate unnecessary `Delay` activities. Use `Retry Scope` with appropriate timeout values for reliable waiting mechanisms. Adjust selectors or logic to reduce wait times for UI interactions.\n\n---\n\n### **Warning: ST-DBP-021 (Hardcoded Timeout)**",
    "**Use Config/Arguments for Timeouts**: Replace hardcoded timeout values with variables or arguments. Store these values in a configuration file (e.g., `Config.xlsx`) for better control and flexibility.\n\n---\n\n### **Warning: UI-DBP-018 (Flow Control)**",
    "**Refactor Flow Control**: Ensure proper use of flow control structures like `Flowchart`, `Sequence`, or `State Machine`. Avoid excessive nesting and replace complex decision-making logic with clear `If` conditions or `Switch` statements.\n\n---\n\n### **Warning: UI-PRF-001 (Performance Impact - Delay Optimization)**",
    "**Optimize Workflow Performance**: Avoid excessive use of `Delay` activities and use proper synchronization methods like `Element Exists`, `Wait for Element`, or `Retry Scope`.\n\n---\n\n### **General Recommendations**",
    "**Workflow Organization**: Break down large workflows into smaller, reusable components. Use the UiPath REFramework for structured automation and improved scalability.",
    "**Testing and Debugging**: Test workflows incrementally and debug using breakpoints and the `Debug` mode in UiPath Studio.",
    "**Documentation**: Create a design document summarizing workflow logic, dependencies, and configurations for reference during updates.\n\n---\n\nBy following these suggestions, you can resolve the identified errors and warnings in your UiPath workflows and improve their overall quality, maintainability, and performance. Let me know if you need clarification on any specific issue!"
