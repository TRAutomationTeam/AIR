    "Here is a comprehensive list of actionable suggestions to address the issues in your UiPath workflows:",
    "---",
    "### **1. [Error] UI-DBP-006 (Missing Exception Handling)**",
    "**Suggestion:**",
    "- Add `TryCatch` blocks around activities that can potentially throw exceptions (e.g., file operations, database calls, UI interactions).",
    "- Use `LogMessage` activities inside the `Catch` block to log error details. Ensure that exceptions are either rethrown or handled appropriately.",
    "---",
    "### **2. [Warning] UI-DBP-013 (Missing Logging)**",
    "**Suggestion:**",
    "- Insert `LogMessage` activities at critical points in the workflow, such as before and after major operations, decision points, and exception handling.",
    "- Use different log levels (`Info`, `Warning`, `Error`) to differentiate between normal flow, potential issues, and errors.",
    "---",
    "### **3. [Warning] UI-DBP-007 (Missing Comments)**",
    "**Suggestion:**",
    "- Add comments to explain complex or non-intuitive logic in your workflows. For example, provide context for loops, decision conditions, or external dependencies.",
    "- Use annotations on activities where applicable to ensure maintainability and clarity.",
    "---",
    "### **4. [Warning] UI-DBP-008 (Hardcoded Values)**",
    "**Suggestion:**",
    "- Move hardcoded values (e.g., file paths, API URLs, timeout values) to a configuration file (`Config.xlsx` or Orchestrator assets).",
    "- Use `Dictionary<String, Object>` arguments or global variables to retrieve these values dynamically during runtime.",
    "---",
    "### **5. [Error] ST-NMG-001 (Missing Naming Convention)**",
    "**Suggestion:**",
    "- Follow UiPath's best practices for naming conventions:",
    "- Variables: Use camelCase (e.g., `transactionData`, `retryCount`).",
    "- Arguments: Use PascalCase prefixed with direction (e.g., `in_ClientName`, `out_Result`).",
    "- Activities: Provide meaningful names (e.g., `ExtractClientData` instead of `Sequence1`).",
    "- Avoid generic names like `Variable1` or `Assign1`.",
    "---",
    "### **6. [Error] ST-USG-002 (Unused Variable Detected)**",
    "**Suggestion:**",
    "- Identify unused variables by reviewing the `Variables` pane and cross-checking with activity dependencies.",
    "- Remove variables that are not referenced anywhere in the workflow.",
    "- Consolidate redundant variables that serve the same purpose.",
    "---",
    "### **7. [Warning] UI-PRF-001 (Performance Impact)**",
    "**Suggestion:**",
    "- Review and optimize `Delay` activities to ensure they are necessary. Replace hardcoded delay times with dynamic retry mechanisms (e.g., `Retry Scope`).",
    "- Minimize the use of unnecessary loops or activities that consume excessive resources.",
    "---",
    "### **8. [Warning] ST-DBP-021 (Hardcoded Timeout)**",
    "**Suggestion:**",
    "- Replace hardcoded timeout values in activities (e.g., `WaitForElement`, `Click`, `TypeInto`) with arguments or configuration entries.",
    "- Use the `Timeout` field dynamically by referencing values stored in a configuration file or Orchestrator asset.",
    "---",
    "### **9. [Warning] UI-DBP-018 (Flow Control)**",
    "**Suggestion:**",
    "- Ensure proper flow control by replacing `Flowchart` or `Sequence` activities with `State Machines` if the logic is complex.",
    "- Avoid deeply nested `If` or `Switch` activities—use modular workflows or invoke reusable components.",
    "---",
    "### **10. [Warning] UI-PRF-001 (Optimize Delay Times)**",
    "**Suggestion:**",
    "- Replace arbitrary delay times with condition-based waits using `Element Exists`, `WaitForElement`, or `Retry Scope` activities.",
    "- Use shorter delays when interacting with UI elements and validate the presence of elements dynamically.",
    "---",
    "### **11. [Warning] UI-DBP-007 (Add Comments for Complex Logic)**",
    "**Suggestion:**",
    "- For workflows with intricate branching, looping, or calculations, annotate activities to explain their purpose.",
    "- Document assumptions, constraints, and dependencies in the comment section of the workflow file.",
    "---",
    "### **12. [Warning] UI-DBP-013 (Add LogMessage Activities for Traceability)**",
    "**Suggestion:**",
    "- Introduce logging before and after decision-making steps, transaction processing, or invoking external services.",
    "- Leverage the `Log Fields` functionality to include contextual data (e.g., transaction ID, client name).",
    "---",
    "### **13. General Suggestions for Workflow Optimization**",
    "**Suggestion:**",
    "- Modularize workflows: Split large workflows into smaller, reusable components for better maintainability.",
    "- Use `Invoke Workflow` activities to call child workflows and manage process flow effectively.",
    "- Regularly review dependencies (e.g., packages, variables, arguments) to ensure they are relevant and up-to-date.",
    "---",
    "### **Implementation Priority**",
    "- **Critical Errors** (e.g., Exception Handling, Naming Conventions, Unused Variables): Address these immediately to ensure functionality and maintainability.",
    "- **Warnings** (e.g., Logging, Hardcoded Values, Comments): Resolve these iteratively to improve traceability, scalability, and clarity.",
    "- **Performance Issues**: Optimize delays and flow control structures to enhance efficiency.",
    "---",
    "Feel free to ask if you need detailed guidance on implementing any of the suggestions above!"
