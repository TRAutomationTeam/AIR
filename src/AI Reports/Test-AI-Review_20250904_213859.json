    "Here is a detailed list of actionable suggestions for each issue found in your UiPath workflows:\n\n---\n\n### Errors",
    "**UI-DBP-006 (Missing Exception Handling)**  \n   **Action:** Add `TryCatch` blocks around sections of your workflows where exceptions are likely to occur (e.g., file handling, database operations, UI interactions). Ensure proper logging and rethrowing of exceptions if necessary for troubleshooting.",
    "**ST-NMG-001 (Missing Naming Convention)**  \n   **Action:** Rename activities, variables, arguments, and workflows to follow UiPath's best practices for naming conventions. For example:  \n   - Variables: Use camelCase (e.g., `clientName`, `transactionData`).  \n   - Arguments: Use PascalCase with direction prefix (e.g., `in_ClientName`, `out_TransactionData`).  \n   - Workflows: Use descriptive names with PascalCase (e.g., `InitAllSettings.xaml`).",
    "**ST-USG-002 (Unused Variable Detected)**  \n   **Action:** Remove unused variables or arguments that are not referenced anywhere in the workflow. Check whether they were intended for use but overlooked, and delete them if unnecessary.\n\n---\n\n### Warnings",
    "**UI-DBP-013 (Missing Logging)**  \n   **Action:** Add `LogMessage` activities at key points in your workflows, such as:  \n   - Workflow start and end.  \n   - Before and after critical operations (e.g., database queries, API calls).  \n   - Inside exception handling blocks for error logging.",
    "**UI-DBP-007 (Missing Comments)**  \n   **Action:** Add comments to explain complex logic, especially in areas where custom workflows, loops, or decision trees are used. Use annotations to clarify why certain actions are performed.",
    "**UI-DBP-008 (Hardcoded Values)**  \n   **Action:** Move hardcoded values to external configuration files (e.g., `Config.xlsx`, `Orchestrator Assets`) or arguments. Reference them dynamically using the `Dictionary` object or `Get Asset` activities.",
    "**UI-PRF-001 (Performance Impact)**  \n   **Action:** Review and optimize delay times or unnecessary waits in your workflows. Replace static delays (`Delay` activity) with dynamic wait conditions (`Element Exists`, `Wait for Element`, or `Retry Scope`).",
    "**ST-DBP-021 (Hardcoded Timeout)**  \n   **Action:** Define timeout values in configuration files or arguments and reference them dynamically in activities. Avoid hardcoding values like `30000` for timeouts; use named constants instead.",
    "**UI-DBP-018 (Flow Control)**  \n   **Action:** Ensure workflows use appropriate flow control structures, such as `Flowchart` for complex branching and `Sequence` for linear operations. Avoid excessive nesting of `If` or `While` activities.\n\n---\n\n### Workflow-Specific Recommendations\n\nFor each workflow, follow these steps:\n\n#### **Main.xaml**\n- Add `TryCatch` blocks (Error UI-DBP-006).  \n- Add `LogMessage` activities (Warning UI-DBP-013).  \n- Add comments to complex logic (Warning UI-DBP-007).  \n- Move hardcoded values to configuration files (Warning UI-DBP-008).  \n- Ensure naming conventions are followed (Error ST-NMG-001).  \n- Remove unused variables (Error ST-USG-002).\n\n#### **Data Service Report\\TestSummary_DataService_CRUD.xaml**\n- Add `TryCatch` blocks (Error UI-DBP-006).  \n- Add `LogMessage` activities (Warning UI-DBP-013).  \n- Ensure naming conventions are followed (Error ST-NMG-001).  \n- Remove unused variables (Error ST-USG-002).\n\n#### **Framework Workflows**\n- Apply logging and naming conventions across all framework workflows.  \n- Add exception handling where missing (Error UI-DBP-006).  \n- Move hardcoded values and timeouts to configuration files (Warning UI-DBP-008, ST-DBP-021).  \n- Optimize delays for performance (Warning UI-PRF-001).  \n- Remove unused variables (Error ST-USG-002).\n\n#### **Performer Workflows**\n- Add `TryCatch` blocks to handle exceptions during UI interactions (Error UI-DBP-006).  \n- Add logging for traceability (Warning UI-DBP-013).  \n- Add comments to clarify logic (Warning UI-DBP-007).  \n- Move hardcoded timeout values and other static parameters to configuration files (Warning ST-DBP-021).  \n- Rename variables and activities to follow UiPath naming conventions (Error ST-NMG-001).  \n- Remove unused variables (Error ST-USG-002).\n\n#### **Test Workflows**\n- Ensure proper logging and traceability (Warning UI-DBP-013).  \n- Add comments to complex sections (Warning UI-DBP-007).  \n- Move hardcoded values to configuration files (Warning UI-DBP-008).  \n- Use consistent naming conventions (Error ST-NMG-001).  \n- Remove unused variables (Error ST-USG-002).\n\n---\n\n### General Best Practices",
    "**Consistency:** Ensure all workflows follow consistent naming, logging, and exception handling practices. Create reusable components for logging and exception handling if applicable.",
    "**Documentation:** Maintain documentation to explain workflow logic, variables, and configuration settings.",
    "**Testing:** After implementing changes, test all workflows to confirm functionality and performance.",
    "**Code Review:** Conduct regular peer reviews to identify areas for improvement and ensure adherence to standards.\n\n---\n\nImplementing these suggestions will improve the maintainability, readability, and performance of your workflows while ensuring compliance with UiPath best practices.
